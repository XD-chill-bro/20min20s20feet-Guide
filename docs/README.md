# 20-20-20 Rule
Take 20-second breaks from looking at a screen every 20 minutes. 
During this break, focus on an object 20 feet away, which relaxes your eye muscles.

## How this should help
Let this program run in a console in the background.
Every 20min you will hear a sound.
You'll be asked to press [Enter]. 
After that you're supposed to look at something about 20 feet away. 
The application will tell you when the 20 seconds are over.
Then you can look at your screen again (for 20min).

This cycle repeads untill you close the application.
